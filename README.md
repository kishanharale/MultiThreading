# MultiThreading

Hereâ€™s a small Java project demonstrating multithreading by simulating a restaurant order processing system using multiple threads.

Project: Restaurant Order Processing

This project simulates a restaurant where:
Customers place orders.
A chef prepares the orders.
A waiter serves the food.

We use threads for each role to run tasks in parallel.
